# DotCraft Development Guide

Project-specific workflow and norms for DotCraft.
For general language and framework style, follow the relevant ecosystem conventions.
For repo orientation, read the applicable `AGENTS.md` files.

## Development Workflow

### Spec-First

When modifying protocol designs or process flows defined in `specs/`, update the spec first, then implement.
If a proposed change conflicts with an existing spec, resolve the spec-level conflict before touching code.

### Steps

1. **Plan**: Search the codebase for similar features before adding new abstractions.
2. **Implement**: Follow the project-specific norms below. Add XML docs for public C# APIs. Update affected user-facing docs and localized content when behavior changes.
3. **Test**: Follow the testing rules below.
4. **Verify**: Confirm changes conform to the relevant spec and docs/examples are in place.

### Tool Schemas And Prompt Cache

When adding or changing model-visible tools, account for prompt cache stability. Avoid changing the tool schema solely because the thread switches operational modes, such as Plan to Agent. Prefer keeping the model-visible tool surface stable and enforcing mode-specific behavior with execution policy, runtime scopes, and prompt guidance.

Mode-specific tool removal is appropriate only when the mode represents a genuinely different role or runtime surface. For ordinary operational constraints, use `ModeToolPolicy` or an equivalent policy guard to reject disallowed calls, and make the current allowed tool usage clear in the system prompt or runtime context.

### Testing Rules

Add tests when an observable contract changes, especially for protocol-dependent behavior and complex multi-step flows or state machines. Pure visual polish, copy changes, trivial refactors, and fixes that do not change an observable contract do not require new tests.

A meaningful test catches a real regression without duplicating existing coverage or testing language, framework, or private implementation details. Prefer assertions on public behavior, state, persisted data, wire payloads, and user-visible output. Use real temporary dependencies or small fakes instead of extensive mocking unless an interaction is itself the contract.

- **Frontend**: Test behavior such as accessibility, state, navigation, IPC, serialization, and data mapping. Do not assert styling details unless geometry or visual state is the functional contract; verify pure polish manually.
- **Core C#**: Test through public APIs and observable results. Skip trivial formatters, getters, record equality, text passthrough, prompt wording, and framework behavior.

### Language Preference

Before changing localized UI or documentation, inspect the repository's current locale configuration, catalogs, and existing mirrors. Treat those as the source of truth and update every currently supported locale; do not rely on a locale list embedded in this skill.

- **Code comments**: English
- **UI strings**: The client owns UI localization. Update every locale discovered from the current source of truth, including message catalogs and data-driven UI text such as localized plugin or extension labels.
- **C# runtime/UI-adjacent messages**: Do not add UI localization state or server-side translation catalogs. C# should emit stable machine-readable keys/codes plus English fallback text (`FallbackText` for CLI/server fallback copy). Desktop owns UI localization.
- **Protocol-visible system messages**: New client-visible notifications and errors must provide a stable key/code, structured params where useful, and an English fallback. User text, model output, and raw tool output must pass through unchanged.
- **Documentation**: Discover the currently supported documentation locales and mirror structure before writing, then update every affected version in the same change.

## Documentation Guidelines

Use `dotcraft-docs-guide` for audience routing, page structure, voice, localization, and site conventions. Before writing, inspect the current documentation structure and supported locales. Place new pages with the appropriate audience, ask only when placement is ambiguous, and document current behavior without historical rationale.
